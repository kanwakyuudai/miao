## Golden Rules for my-self

- Turn off Chinese input during coding / using command line.
- Always write commit notes in English.
- File path don't contain any non-ascii character.
- Use keyboard shortcuts as many as possible.
- Don't hate reading English tutorial / documents.
- Use LF instead of CRLF at end of line in every file.
